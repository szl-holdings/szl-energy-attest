"""Standards-interop + compliance-evidence layer for governed-inference receipts.

A governed-inference receipt (see :mod:`._receipt`) is an honest, tamper-evident,
hash-chained record of one metered inference call. This module lets that record
*speak the wider ecosystem's language* without changing a single measured value:

  1. :func:`to_intoto_statement` renders a receipt as an **in-toto Statement v1**
     — the exact JSON payload that Sigstore / DSSE / IETF SCITT tooling already
     knows how to carry, sign, and store in a transparency log. The predicate is
     laid out in SLSA-v1 provenance shape (``buildDefinition`` / ``runDetails``).
  2. :func:`compliance_evidence` maps the receipt onto the specific **EU AI Act**
     articles and **NIST AI RMF** functions it provides operational evidence for
     and — per the honesty doctrine — states plainly what it does **NOT** establish.
  3. :func:`verify_statement` re-derives the receipt body digest and confirms the
     Statement's subject is bound to that exact receipt.

CONSOLIDATION (the ecosystem shapes + regulator catalogue live in ONE place):
  The in-toto Statement envelope, the SLSA-shaped predicate skeleton, the
  EU AI Act / NIST AI RMF control catalogue, and the subject-digest verifier are
  the SHARED :mod:`szl_receipt.attest` module — the same library that already
  provides receipt signing. This module is a thin, receipt-schema-specific
  adapter over it: it maps this package's receipt fields onto capability flags
  and predicate parameters, then delegates the ecosystem-facing shapes. That
  keeps a single source of truth so the regulator mapping can never drift
  between SZL packages. Attestation is therefore an interop feature that, like
  signing, requires the shared ``szl-receipt`` library (install extra ``[sign]``);
  the import is lazy so importing this package stays zero-hard-dependency.

HONESTY (Λ = Conjecture 1, advisory — NOT a theorem):
  * We emit our OWN predicate type URI. We do NOT claim official SLSA-provenance
    conformance; the shape is SLSA-*inspired* for recognizability only.
  * Energy fields are copied verbatim from the receipt. When the receipt is
    ``mode="unmeasured"`` the energy evidence is reported ``UNAVAILABLE`` — never
    a fabricated joule or efficiency number.
  * A receipt is EVIDENCE toward a control, never a conformity assessment,
    certification, or safety guarantee. Every mapping entry carries an explicit
    ``does_not_establish`` note.
  * Stdlib only in this module. Nothing is written to disk or the network here;
    signing (DSSE/Sigstore) is a separate, out-of-band concern.
